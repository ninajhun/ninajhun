## 👩🏽‍💻 Hi, I’m Nina!

I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer currently looking for opportunities to launch my career in the Tech Industry. My current stack includes JavaScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and CSS, but I’m constantly learning more! 

## 🌱  I’m currently learning...
- Socket.io
- React Hooks 
- Chakra UI
